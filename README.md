# highlight-hugo.el

**highlight-hugo.el** is a small Emacs Lisp command-line utility that applies syntax highlighting to all code blocks found in a website generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), leveraging Emacs' powerful font locking and major modes.

It currently uses the [`htmlize`](https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize) package to convert code highlighted by Emacs to HTML.

## Usage

This program is only known to work under Linux.

To use it, just run:

``` sh
highlight-hugo hugo-publish-dir
```

where `hugo-publish-dir` is the `public/` directory generated by Hugo.
